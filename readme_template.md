# Cloud Compose cluster plugin
The Cloud Compose cluster plugin simplifies the process of running Docker images on cloud servers. To use this plugin you need three files:

1. docker-compose.yml for local testing of Docker images
1. docker-compose.override.yml for overriding values specific to cloud environments 
1. cluster.sh script for bootstrapping a new cloud server

For an example project that uses Cloud Compose see [Docker MongoDB](https://github.com/washingtonpost/docker-mongodb).

Once you have the configuration files run the following commands to start the cluster: 
```
cd my-configs
pip install cloud-compose cloud-compose-cluster
pip freeze -r > requirements.txt
cloud-compose cluster up
```

Although the cluster plugins is designed to be cloud agnostic, AWS is the only cloud provider currently supported.  Support for other cloud providers is welcomed as pull requests.

### AWS backend
If you are using the AWS backend the cluster plugin uses the [Boto](http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) client which requires the following environment variables:

* AWS_REGION
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

If you are using multiple AWS accounts it is convenient to use [Envdir](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/envdir) to easily switch between AWS accounts.

## Configuration 
To understand the purpose of each configuration file consider the follow examples with an explanation of each element.

### cloud-compose.yml
```yaml
cluster:
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
  search_path:
    - docker-mongodb
    - docker-mongodb/cloud-compose/templates
  aws:
    ami: ${IMAGE_ID}
    username: ${IMAGE_USERNAME}
    terminate_protection: false
    security_groups: ${SECURITY_GROUP_ID}
    ebs_optimized: false
    instance_type: t2.medium
    keypair: drydock
    volumes:
      - name: root
        size: 30G
      - name: docker
        size: 20G
        block: /dev/xvdz
        file_system: lvm2
        meta:
          group: docker
          volumes:
            - name: data 
              size: 19G
            - name: metadata
              size: 900M 
      - name: data
        size: 10G
        block: /dev/xvdc
        file_system: ext4
        meta:
          format: true
          mount: /data/mongodb
    tags:
      datadog: monitored
    nodes:
      - id: 0
        ip: ${CLUSTER_NODE_0_IP}
        subnet: ${CLUSTER_NODE_0_SUBNET}
      - id: 1
        ip: ${CLUSTER_NODE_1_IP}
        subnet: ${CLUSTER_NODE_1_SUBNET}
      - id: 2
        ip: ${CLUSTER_NODE_2_IP}
        subnet: ${CLUSTER_NODE_2_SUBNET}
```

#### name
The ``name`` is the unique name of this cluster. This is also added as a tag to each server called ClusterName.

#### search_path 
The ``search_path`` is the directories that will be examined when looking for configuration files like the ``cluster.sh`` file and the ``docker-compose.override.yml``.

#### AWS
The AWS section contains information needed to create the cluster on AWS.

##### ami
The ``ami`` is the Amazon Machine Image to start the EC2 servers from before installing the Docker containers that you want to run on these servers. The ``ami`` can either be an AMI ID (e.g. ami-1234567) or the Name tag applied to the AMI (e.g. docker:1.10). If the same Name tag exists on multiple images the newest image will be selected when creating a new cluster. If the cluster is being upgraded and is not an autoscaling group, then the Name tag will resolve to the same image in use by other cluster nodes. This will ensure that all nodes are running the same image. To override this behavior and resolve the Namge tag to the latest version regardless of whether cluster nodes will be consistent, use the --upgrade-image option on the cluster up command. Autoscaling group clusters are always upgrade to the latest image when using the Name tag reference because the launch config already provides a way for restoring cluster nodes such that all instances have the same image.

##### username
The ``username`` is used by the ``cluster.sh`` script to start the Docker containers using that user account.

##### terminate_protection (optional)
``terminate_protection`` is an EC2 feature that prevents accidently termination of servers. If this value is not provided it defaults to true, which is the recommended setting for production clusters.

##### security
The list of ``security_groups`` that should be added to the EC2 servers.

##### ebs_optimized (optional)
Set ``ebs_optimized`` to true if you want EC2 servers with this featured turned on. The default value is false.

##### instance_type
The ``instance_type`` you want to use for the EC2 servers.

##### keypair
The ``keypair`` is the SSH key that will be added to the EC2 servers.

##### volumes
The ``volumes`` is a list of volumes that should be added to the instance. All volumes have a ``size`` attribute which is a number followed by a unit of M, G, or T for megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes.

###### root
The ``root`` volume is the main volume for the server.  Only the ``size`` attribute can be set for this volume. The ``root`` volume is automatically mounted on server start.

###### docker
The ``docker`` volume is an LVM2 designed for use by Centos/RHEL servers that use the device-mapper backend for storing Docker image and metadata.

###### data
If you need to keep significant data on the instance create a data volume rather than putting the data on the root volume. This will make backups and restores much easier since the operating system files are not mixed with the data files. The ``data`` volume should also have mount point which is then mounted in your Docker container as a volume.

#### tags
Additional ``tags`` that should be added to the EC2 instance.

#### nodes
The ``nodes`` is a list of servers that make up the cluster.  Autoscaling groups are not recommended for database servers because the cluster membership can change quickly which can lead to data loss. Since many databases work better with static IP addresses, using static IP addresses is the default behavior of the cluster plugin. It is recommend that a separate subnet be created for servers using static IP addresses to avoid collisions with auto provisioned servers using dynamic IP addresses. Make sure to add a node for each subnet and use at least three nodes in three different availability zones for maximum redundancy. 

## Extending
The cluster plugin was designed to support many different systems including MongoDB, Kafka, and Zookeeper, but it does require some scripting and configuration first.  See the [Docker MongoDB](https://github.com/washingtonpost/docker-mongodb) for an example project. You can add additional server platforms by creating a similar project and adapting the configuration and script files as needed.

## Contributing 
To work on the code locally, checkout both cloud-compose and cloud-compose-cluster to the same parent directory. Then use a virtualenv and pip install editable to start working on them locally.
```
mkvirtualenv cloud-compose
pip install --editable cloud-compose
pip install --editable cloud-compose-cluster
```

Make sure to add unit tests for new code. You can run them using the standard setup tools command:

```
python setup.py test
```
